In this lab I learnt how to use GitHub to manage versions of my code. I also learnt how to track changes over time. I also learnt how to create branches and merge them back into the main branch. Creating a semantic HTML portfolio helped me understand the importance of proper structure in web pages. Deploying the sit to GitHub Pages showed me how simple it is to host a basic website online.
